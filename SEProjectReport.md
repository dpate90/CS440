Project Description
===================

Project Overview
----------------

A brief description of the product to be produced, before getting into
details.

[]{#_Toc461441756 .anchor}A virtual reality based program that educates
children on elementary topics such as basic arithmetic, colors, and
shapes.

The Purpose of the Project 
---------------------------

### The User Business or Background of the Project Effort

Our group has decided to create a virtual reality based product to
educate young children. This product will be compatible with an HTC
Vive. This program will be able to be downloaded onto a computer with a
high-definition graphic card. Graphics using Unity 3D will need to be
made, in a setting where virtual reality applications can be tested
using controllers and screens. Our project was inspired by nostalgic
memories of playing with wood blocks as children. It also reminded us of
cartoon shows where questions would be asked, and we would have to wait
years to answer like Dora the Explorer and Blues Clues. This product
will be available for download online, and be marketed towards young
parents.

*Motivation*

The motivation for this project is to provide a program that will teach
kids what was once taught to us on educational television shows, but
with much more interaction, creating a more realistic experience for the
child. This would allow children to learn quicker, and be more
independent in their thinking.

*Considerations*

[]{#_Toc461441758 .anchor}In certain cases, where children have children
disabilities, the problem is very serious, and these children need
special attention and time to learn new things. Our application will
help kids with learning disabilities as well, because it is making
learning fun, and the children will be able to incorporate education
with “real-life”.

### Goals of the Project

The real reason for this project is to make education fun for little
kids and more interactive. It will help them learn better and be more
independent. There are high chances that the development team may forget
the main purpose of the project and may end up going in a different
direction. To keep the team motivated towards the main goal of the
project and to avoid the danger of losing the main purpose of this
project, there should be meetings on a regular basis to remind the team
what the main goal. To do that it may be necessary to appoint a person
to be custodian of the goals, but it is probably sufficient to make the
goals public and periodically remind the developers of them. It should
be mandatory to acknowledge the goals at every review session. It’s
available in a form of a CD or available to download on a computer.
[]{#_Toc461441759 .anchor}

### Measurement 

The main goal of this project is the give the users i.e. the children
between age 5 – 8 and interactive way of learning. The main target
audience for this software would be grade schools and customers with
kids between that age who has HTC VIVE or Oculus Rift. This project has
a lot of potential since we can replace from having extra teachers in
the class to this automation which just requires a person

[]{#_Toc461441760 .anchor}Initially we will try to demo it in few grade
school and get reviews from the kids and teacher and depending on the
response we can either modify or make more changes. This is to make sure
we have a good understanding of what the main product should look like.

The Scope of the Work – Dhruv is doing This
-------------------------------------------

### The Current Situation

This product will be used in an educational environment such as a school
or tutoring center. It will change the existing processes in schools by
requiring kids thought the world getting same level of educational
foundation. []{#_Toc461441762 .anchor}This product will be used instead
of teachers giving students individual attention to learn, which will
change the education system in schools and tutoring centers. Since it is
meant for grade school students for now, it will have a bigger audience
not only in sates but thought out the world. Especially, in the
developing or undeveloped countries where kids don’t have the access to
good education resources.

### The Context of the Work – Mariam needs help

Some external people that we would need to be involved in this project
are graphics designers, HTC, and an A/V team to help us with any
technical issues that arise during our set up and testing of our
project. The core of this project will

### Competing Products

There are some educational games out there like Jigsaw Puzzle, letter
blocks and more but they’re not in VR form. You can’t interact with
those games. They are used for educational purposes but are not used
classroom settings. To make sure that the product is being used to its
fullest potential and it meets all the requirement for kids to educate
themselves. The game is going to be design with the help of child
psychologist and a lot of research will go behind the actual game to
make sure that the users are benefiting from it and getting the
education they need. []{#_Toc461441765 .anchor}

The Scope of the Product
------------------------

This project will include various sensors that will interact with the
movement of the children. These movements will be captured and analyzed
to update correctly the program. Some external entities that will
interact with our product, aside from the users, will be the camera and
sensors. There will be a controller that the users will have. This will
directly show the hand movements and interactions by the user with the
program. Our hardware will be HTC Vive using the Unity engine for the
creation.

works. So they need to have their lesson plans set out for them. The
kids will come into class and put their VR headsets in their special
room so that the sensors and video cameras will record and analyze the
work that they do. They will

Stakeholders 
-------------

### The Client 

A client for our product is an institution for educating children. This
product can be used for grade school children but it can be expanded to
middle school and high school by adding content to the product. But as
of right now since we are focusing on grade school students. Hence,
following are the names of our clients around Chicago area.

-   Mundelein community grade school

-   Stevenson grade school

> The client role in this project is going to be specifying the school
> curriculum and to provide their budget and system description on which
> they are planning to host the application. This application uses room
> space; the client is also supposed to have a dedicated space.

### The Customer

A client for our product is an institution for educating children. This
product can be used for grade school children but it can be expanded to
middle school and high school by adding content to the product. But as
of right now since we are focusing on grade school students. Hence,
following are the names of our clients around Chicago area.

-   Mundelein community grade school

-   Stevenson grade school

[]{#_Toc461441772 .anchor}To meet the client or the customer’s
requirement the project will require the help of professionals who
understand the need to educate grade level students and their
psychology. We shall also provide a month free trail which will include
the entire set to test how the students responded and if it is in the
client’s interest to buy this product.

### Hands-On Users of the Product 

● User name/category: Schoolchildren

● User role: Use the virtual reality game, participate in the activities
and answer questions

● Subject matter experience: The children playing this game will be
beginner users, new to the game. So, novice.

● Technological experience: Being children, they will have exposure to
other children games and technology such as iPad and iPhone games. So,
novice.

● Other user characteristics: This game is meant for children who are in
preschool through fifth grade. There will be a variety of difficulty
levels and topics that range from adding and subtracting, to division
and multiplication. Age group and grade level will play into factor in
choosing the difficulty level. Children with learning disabilities are
the motivation in a virtual reality educational game such as this one,
because they have a chance to learn math beyond simply looking at
numbers and symbols.

[]{#_Toc461441773 .anchor}Some users we have incorporated into our
project are the HTC Company, because we are using their HTC Vive device
and have to keep up with the HTC Vive System Updates and be in
communication regarding the device when troubleshooting. We also have a
Graphic Designer as a user because they are in charge of the visuals and
animations required for this project. Another user, the Audio/Visual
(A/V) Team, will be in contact with us to help set up the device, and
help us in times of technical issues.

### Priorities Assigned to Users

Key User: Graphic Designer

Secondary User: A/V Technician, HTC

Unimportant user: N/A

[]{#_Toc461441774 .anchor} The focus group for these products are
education institution. More specifically it will be the grade school and
middle schools. Since our product currently focuses on content for small
kids, the plan is to get the feedback from the users i.e. the kids and
see how they respond to it. If this turns out to be successful and helps
the kids, we will try to incorporate more content. Since grade school
students are good at picking things up when they play and also their
content being the addition of content or update.

### User Participation

As from the client side it will be necessary for institution or
academies to give the descriptions of their course work. The client
would need to have a dedicated space and have an instructor to learn the
technology and can supervise students while they are using the product.
They also need a server with GPU of Nvidia GeFOrce GTX970, or AMD Radeon
R9 290 equivalent or greater and HTV Vive which will be either provided
with the software or can also be order and a client technician can set
up for them.

### Maintenance Users and Service Technicians

HTC Vive is a product which will need some technical knowledge to set-up
and installation for the program. Since the targets user are grade
school students, we want to make sure it is a same environment for them.
This device which is HTC Vive will require maintain ace and some
technical some technical training to set up the device.

\(1) Easy to use functionality: Make sure that the AI system and the
visuals are easy on the eyes and not too confusing to navigate through

1.  Teacher controlled: The teacher has autonomy on the lessons
    administered and graded

2.  Friendly colors: this is strictly in the visuals. Needs to be child
    friendly and not intense

3.  Common sense understanding: the UI needs to be in a common sense
    method. No complex “clicks” to get to the end result.

4.  Understanding the logic behind the code: When coding or writing out
    the design of the project to use. There are certain logical designs
    that need to be implemented. This is why the Unity engine is used to
    make the proper systematic approach in the construction. This will
    pair perfectly with the HTC Vive.

5.  Stabilization: With the use of HTC Vive, we need to account for the
    camera set up. Due to many different technologies out there, we need
    to limit our spending and cost. This requires us to invest in a
    stabilizing camera, so a stable environment can be rendered for the
    children. Stabilization is important for the spotting and
    interaction notice from the users.

6.  A safe environment: Since our product requires a room to be built
    and set up in a manner that is geared towards the product, we would
    need to make sure that those accessing the room are not at risk.
    This would require us to invest in gold plated wiring, wall mounting
    rotating cameras. The walls would need to be fitted with foam and
    soft material.

Examples

> Description: Users will use the head piece and the controllers to
> interact with the product in a stable room fitted with body
> recognizing cameras.
>
> Rationale: The room is necessary for the data to be read and
> registered in an accurate manner
>
> Fit criterion: All movements will be analyzed and registered to give
> the users the best experience
>
> Description: The cameras will need to be fitted to be stable and view
> the student from all angles. This will mean that the room needs to
> have multiple cameras to see all angles.
>
> Rationale: This is because any shaking will cause the body of the user
> to be distorted and the program will not register the movements
> properly.
>
> Fit criterion: The Product will be HTC Vive exclusive.
>

### Implementation Environment of the Current System

The product will be installed on hand held devices, owned or lent to
schools, that will have the software and the capability to interact with
the HTC Vive.

### Partner or Collaborative Applications

Computers, green screens, cameras to monitor activity, etc. A computer
is required for the HTC Vive application, but because it is a high
definition virtual reality device, a special graphic card will be needed
for the computer to ensure proper visuals We will also need to use Unity
3D, Microsoft Visual Studio, and blender which will be used by the
graphic designer and the programmers.

###  Off-the-Shelf Software

This software can also be distributed off-the-shelf so that it can be
used as any commercial software and be ready to us. But to use this
software the machine or system on which this is application will be
hosted should meet the minimum requirement of being able to run certain
graphic. This program will be able to be downloaded onto a computer with
a high-definition graphic card. Graphics using Unity 3D will need to be
made, in a setting where virtual reality applications can be tested
using controllers and screens.

### Anticipated Workplace Environment

The work place for this project must be at least 10 ft x 10 ft room so
that the HTC Vive can be set-up

Also there should always be a trainer teacher monitoring the user and
keep track of the progress.

### Schedule Constraints 

*Content*

Have a working prototype by the beginning of a school year, and then
have a product released by mid-year. So there is so level of hype that
is created

Motivation

Having something to show by the beginning of the year gives us working
data and tweaks we can make before releasing something substantial

*Considerations*

The deadline for a product release would be the end of a calendar year.
But the testing product can be released for secure testing by users at
the beginning of a school year

> ● What happens if we don’t build the product by the end of the
> calendar year?
>
> ● What is the financial impact of not having the product by the
> beginning of the Christmas buying season?

-   Is there a leeway if the product cannot be released for testing by
    the beginning of the school year?

We do plan to have the product demoed initially to the client and
depending on the

### 

### Budget Constraints

> If the product is too expensive for the users to get into their
> schools, then that will defeat the purpose of supplying it to them.

Naming Conventions and Definitions
----------------------------------

### Definitions of Key Terms 

HTC Vive: This is a VR headset that will provide the kids an interact
way of learning.

Controllers: These controller will track the users gesture and perform
the necessary task.

Unity 3D: This is a 3D modeling software that will be used by the
Graphic Designer to make the shapes more appealing and content more
interesting.

### UML and Other Notation Used in This Document

This document generally follows the Version 2.0 OMG UML standard, as
described by Fowler in . Any exceptions are noted where used.

Relevant Facts and Assumptions
------------------------------

### Facts

[]{#_Toc461441791 .anchor}The HTC Vive game uses Blender, Unity 3D, and
HTV Vive software for application development and its interactive
feather helps student learn faster.

### Assumptions

The main assumption is that the combination of the software’s will work.

> To run the appropriate graphics for this application the customers
> system must have the appropriate situation.

Requirements
============

Product Use Cases \_ Dhruv 
---------------------------

This section begins to describe in more specific and precise detail
exactly what steps the system takes in the course of its performance.
Use cases serve not only to more specifically define the system ( and
its boundaries ), but also to identify functional requirements, to
identify initial objects / classes, and to organize the work.

### Use Case Diagrams

Use Case diagrams serve two purposes: As a form of graphical table of
contents listing the individual use-cases, and also to define the
boundary of what is included as part of the proposed system and what is
not included.

A use case diagram identifies the boundaries between the users (actors)
and the product. You arrive at the product boundary by inspecting each
business use case and determining, in conjunction with the appropriate
stakeholders, which part of the business use case should be automated
(or satisfied by some sort of product) and what part should be done by
the user. This task must take into account the abilities of the actors
(section 3), the constraints (section 4), the goals of the project
(section 1), and your knowledge of both the work and the technology that
can make the best contribution to the work.

The use case diagram shows the actors outside the product boundary (the
rectangle). The product use cases are the ellipses inside the boundary.
The lines denote usage. Note that actors can be either automated or
human.

Depending on the complexity of the product it may be necessary to use
more than one diagram to list all of the use cases. When more than one
diagram is required the use-cases can be divided up several ways: Normal
operations versus exceptional cases, or daily tasks versus monthly
tasks, or user tasks versus administration tasks, etc.

*Example*

![](media/image4.wmf){width="5.479861111111111in"
height="5.320138888888889in"}

Derive the product use cases by deciding where the product boundary
should be for each business use case. These decisions are based on your
knowledge of the work and the requirements constraints.

![](media/image5.png){width="6.055555555555555in"
height="4.611111111111111in"}

### Product Use Case List

The use case diagram is a graphical way of summarizing the product use
cases relevant to the product. If you have a large number of product use
cases (we find 15–20 is a good limit), then it is better to make a list
of the product use cases and model or describe each one individually.

### Individual Product Use Cases

Use cases are similar to scenarios, in that both tell the story of how
the system interacts with the user(s) in response to some business event
or while conducting some business task. The difference is that use-cases
are much more formal, with certain pre-determined sections for each
use-case, and that use-cases indicate clearly what action the system
takes in response to what actions taken by the user.

For example, here is Figure 4.7 from "Object Oriented Software
Engineering" by Bruegge and DuToit:

![I:\\Course
Folders\\CourseNotes\\OO\_SoftwareEngineering\\images\\Chapter4\\Fig4-7.jpg](media/image6.jpeg){width="5.573611111111111in"
height="5.186805555555556in"}

Functional Requirements
-----------------------

Content

A specification for each functional requirement. As with all types of
requirements, use the requirements shell*.* A full explanation is
included in this template’s introductory material.

Motivation

To specify the detailed functional requirements for the activity of the
product.

Examples

![](media/image7.wmf){width="5.8in" height="3.6798611111111112in"}

Fit Criterion

Each functional requirement should have a fit criterion or a test case.
In any event, the fit criterion is the benchmark to allow the tester to
determine whether the implemented product has met the requirement.

Considerations

If you have produced an event/use case list (see sections 7b and 8a),
then you can use it to help you trigger the functional requirements for
each event/use case. If you have not produced an event/use case list,
give each functional requirement a unique number and, to help with
traceability, partition these requirements into event/use case–related
groups later in the development process.

Data Requirements 
------------------

Content

A specification of the essential subject matter, business objects,
entities, and classes that are germane to the product. It might take the
form of a first-cut class model, an object model, or a domain model.
Alternatively, these requirements might be described by defining the
terms in the dictionary described in section 5.

Motivation

To clarify the system’s subject matter, thereby triggering recognition
of requirements not yet considered.

Example

This is a model of the system’s business subject matter using the
Unified Modeling Language (UML) class model notation.

![](media/image8.wmf){width="5.8in" height="3.0131944444444443in"}

You can use any type of data or object model to capture this knowledge.
The issue is to capture the meaning of the business subject matter and
the connections between the individual parts, and to show that you are
consistent within your project. If you have an established company
standard notation, use that, as it will help you to reuse knowledge
between projects.

![](media/image9.png){width="6.5in" height="2.45625in"}

Considerations

Are there any data or object models for similar or overlapping systems
that might be a useful starting point? Is there a domain model for the
subject matter dealt with by this system?

Performance Requirements
------------------------

### Speed and Latency Requirements

Content

Specifies the amount of time available to complete specified tasks.
These requirements often refer to response times. They can also refer to
the product’s ability to operate at a speed suitable for the intended
environment.

We will have time constraints on answering questions based on the
mathematical questions given to the children. The time the child takes
to answer questions will be recorded, and there will be a timer to
implement this.

Motivation

Some products—usually real-time products—must be able to perform some of
their functionality within a given time slot. Failure to do so may mean
catastrophic failure (e.g., a ground-sensing radar in an airplane fails
to detect an upcoming mountain) or the product will not cope with the
required volume of use (e.g., an automated ticket-selling machine).

The motivation behind the timed questions is to get children to answer
questions, and children can see what questions took them longer, and
what they did quickly during the review of the answers they have given.
Failure to answer questions in the given time will cause the child to
have to repeat similar questions until they answer in the given amount
of time, or else they are asked to answer questions with less
difficulty. This scaling of difficulty will be implemented with each
question, where each question will have its own “weight”.

Examples

Any interface between a user and the automated system shall have a
maximum response time of 2 seconds.

The response shall be fast enough to avoid interrupting the user’s flow
of thought.

The product shall poll the sensor every 10 seconds.

The product shall download the new status parameters within 5 minutes of
a change.

-----------------------------------------

The movement of the blocks will have a maximum response time of 5
seconds.

The gestures given by the children to move these blocks will have a
maximum response time of 5 seconds (&lt;5 seconds for the blocks to be
placed in the desired location on the screen)

The question interface will be displayed within 30 seconds after all
blocks have been displayed, and the number of blocks moved will be
displayed for basic counting learning.

For the mathematical operation questions, the questions will be
displayed within 10 seconds of being chosen.

The response time to answer these questions will be based on the
difficulty of the questions, but no longer than 1 minute per question.
This time can be adjusted to be shorter for a “times table”
implementation, similar to multiplication and division tables that we
were given as children, where questions are displayed rapidly, where
questions can be skipped, and the review section will display the score.

Fit Criterion

Fit criteria are needed when the description of the requirement is not
quantified. However, we find that most performance requirements are
stated in quantified terms. The exception is the second requirement
shown above, for which the suggested fit criterion is

The product shall respond in less than 1 second for 90 percent of the
interrogations. No response shall take longer than 2.5 seconds.

Considerations

There is a wide variation in the importance of different types of speed
requirements. If you are working on a missile guidance system, then
speed is extremely important. By contrast, an inventory control report
that is run once every six months has very little need for a
lightning-fast response time.

Customize this section of the template to give examples of the speed
requirements that are important within your environment.

### Precision or Accuracy Requirements

Content

Quantification of the desired accuracy of the results produced by the
product.

We hope to achieve progress being made throughout the activities,
increasing difficulty level the more the child plays.

Motivation

To set the client’s and users’ expectations for the precision of the
product.

Examples

All monetary amounts shall be accurate to two decimal places.

Accuracy of road temperature readings shall be within ±2°C.

All answers shall be accurate and every wrong answer shall be marked as
incorrect.

Considerations

If you have done any detailed work on definitions, then some precision
requirements might be adequately defined by definitions in section 5.

You might consider which units the product is intended to use. Readers
will recall the spacecraft that crashed on Mars when coordinates were
sent as metric data rather than imperial data.

**The product might also need to keep accurate time, be synchronized
with a time server, or work in UTC. **

Also, be aware that some currencies have no decimal places, such as the
Japanese yen.

**A timer will need to be implemented. **

### Capacity Requirements

Content

This section specifies the volumes that the product must be able to deal
with and the amount of data stored by the product.

Our product will have to deal with very large files, because there will
be high graphics used. Therefore, we will be using computers solely for
the purpose of making this game, nothing extra on them. As well as
having large amounts of external hard drives, that can include terabytes
of data.

Motivation

To ensure that the product is capable of processing the expected
volumes.

Examples

The product shall cater for 300 simultaneous users within the period
from 9:00 <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.m.</span> to 11:00
<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.m</span>. Maximum loading at
other periods will be 150 simultaneous users.

During a launch period, the product shall cater for a maximum of 20
people to be in the inner chamber.

Our product can allow for no more than one user at a time, because we
want the child to be focused on learning solo.

Fit Criterion

In this case, the requirement description is quantified, and thus can be
tested.

Dependability Requirements
--------------------------

### Reliability Requirements

Content

This section quantifies the necessary reliability of the product. The
reliability is usually expressed as the allowable time between failures,
or the total allowable failure rate.

We will have 2 weeks between testing each portion of the game, and daily
meetings to talk about and try to fix issues with the product.

Motivation

It is critical for some products not to fail too often. This section
allows you to explore the possibility of failure and to specify
realistic levels of service. It also gives you the opportunity to set
the client’s and users’ expectations about the expected frequency and
significance of potential failures.

Examples

The product shall not fail more than once per day.

No data shall be lost or damaged in the event of a failure. ( This is an
example of a ***fail-safe*** requirement, which states that the product
is allowed to fail, but it must do so safely. )

All changes being made will be noted, big or small, so if failure
occurs, the makers of the product can backtrack and see what they did
wrong.

Considerations

Consider carefully whether the real requirement for your product is that
it is available for use or that it does not fail at any time.

Consider also the cost of reliability and availability, and whether it
is justified for your product.

### Availability Requirements

Content

This section quantifies the necessary availability of the product. The
availability is usually expressed as the fraction of total time that the
system is up and available for use.

Availability is a function of the mean time between failures, the mean
time required to bring the system back up after a failure, and the mean
time the system is expected to be down for routine maintenance.

Motivation

There is a subtle distinction between how often a system goes down (
reliability )3and how much total time it spends being down (
availability ). This section allows you to specify realistic
expectations about the amount of time that the product will be available
for use.

Examples

The product shall be available for use 24 hours per day, 365 days per
year.

The product shall be available for use between the hours of 8:00 <span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.m.</span> and 5:30 <span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">p.m</span>.

The escalator shall run from 6 <span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.m.</span> until 10 <span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">p.m</span>. or the last flight arrives.

The product shall achieve 99 percent uptime.

Considerations

Consider carefully whether the real requirement for your product is that
it is available for use or that it does not fail at any time.

Consider also the cost of reliability and availability, and whether it
is justified for your product.

The sections on reliability and availability can sometimes be combined.

### Robustness or Fault-Tolerance Requirements

Content

Robustness specifies the ability of the product to continue to function
under abnormal circumstances.

Motivation

To ensure that the product is able to provide some or all of its
services after or during some abnormal happening in its environment.

Examples

The product shall continue to operate in local mode whenever it loses
its link to the central server.

The product shall provide 10 minutes of emergency operation should it
become disconnected from the electricity source.

Considerations

Abnormal happenings can almost be considered normal. Today’s products
are so large and complex that there is a good chance that at any given
time, one component will not be functioning correctly. Robustness
requirements are intended to prevent total failure of the product.

You could also consider disaster recovery in this section. This plan
describes the ability of the product to reestablish acceptable
performance after faults or abnormal happenings.

### Safety-Critical Requirements

Content

Quantification of the perceived risk of damage to people, property, and
environment. Different countries have different standards, so the fit
criteria must specify precisely which standards the product must meet.

Motivation

To understand and highlight the damage that could potentially occur when
using the product within the expected operational environment.

Examples

The product shall not emit noxious gases that damage people’s health.

The heat exchanger shall be shielded from human contact.

Fit Criterion

The product shall be certified to comply with the Health Department’s
standard E110-98. It is to be certified by qualified testing engineers.

No member of a test panel of \[specified size\] shall be able to touch
the heat exchanger. The heat exchanger must also comply with safety
standard \[specify which one\].

Considerations

The example requirements given here apply to some, but not all,
products. It is not possible to give examples of every variation of
safety-critical requirement. To make the template work in your
environment, you should customize it by adding examples that are
specific to your products.

Also, be aware that different countries have different safety standards
and laws relating to safety. If you plan to sell your product
internationally, you must be aware of these laws. A colleague has
suggested that for electrical products, if you follow the German
standards, the largest number of countries will be supported.

If you are building safety-critical systems, then the relevant
safety-critical standards are already well specified. You will likely
have safety experts on your staff. These experts are the best source of
the relevant safety-critical requirements for your type of product. They
will almost certainly have copious information that you can use.

Consult your legal department. Members of this department will be aware
of the kinds of lawsuits that have resulted from product safety failure.
This is probably the best starting place for generating relevant safety
requirements.

Maintainability and Supportability Requirements
-----------------------------------------------

### Maintenance Requirements

Content

A quantification of the time necessary to make specified changes to the
product.

Motivation

To make everyone aware of the maintenance needs of the product.

Examples

New MIS reports must be available within one working week of the date
when the requirements are agreed upon.

A new weather station must be able to be added to the system overnight.

Considerations

There may be special requirements for maintainability, such as that the
product must be able to be maintained by its end users or by developers
who are not the original developers. These requirements have an effect
on the way that the product is developed. In addition, there may be
requirements for documentation or training.

You might also consider writing testability requirements in this
section.

### Supportability Requirements

Content

This specifies the level of support that the product requires. Support
is often provided via a help desk. If people will provide support for
the product, that service is considered part of the product: Are there
any requirements for that support? You might also build support into the
product itself, in which case this section is the place to write those
requirements.

Motivation

To ensure that the support aspect of the product is adequately
specified.

Considerations

Consider the anticipated level of support, and what forms it might take.
For example, a constraint might state that there is to be no printed
manual. Alternatively, the product might need to be entirely
self-supporting.

### Adaptability Requirements

Content

Description of other platforms or environments to which the product must
be ported.

Motivation

To quantify the client’s and users’ expectations about the platforms on
which the product will be able to run.

Examples

The product is expected to run under Windows XP and Linux.

The product might eventually be sold in the Japanese market.

The product is designed to run in offices, but we intend to have a
version running in restaurant kitchens.

Fit Criterion

Specification of system software on which the product must operate.

Specification of future environments in which the product is expected to
operate.

Time allowed to make the transition.

Considerations

Question your marketing department to discover unstated assumptions that
have been made about the portability of the product.

### Scalability or Extensibility Requirements

Content

This specifies the expected increases in size that the product must be
able to handle. As a business grows (or is expected to grow), our
software products must increase their capacities to cope with the new
volumes.

Motivation

To ensure that the designers allow for future capacities.

Examples

The product shall be capable of processing the existing 100,000
customers. This number is expected to grow to 500,000 customers within
three years.

The product shall be able to process 50,000 transactions per hour within
two years of its launch.

### Longevity Requirements

Content

This specifies the expected lifetime of the product.

Motivation

To ensure that the product is built based on an understanding of
expected return on investment.

Examples

The product shall be expected to operate within the maximum maintenance
budget for a minimum of five years.

Security Requirements
---------------------

### Access Requirements

Content

Specification of who has authorized access to the product (both
functionality and data), under what circumstances that access is
granted, and to which parts of the product access is allowed.

Motivation

To understand the expectations for confidentiality aspects of the
system.

Examples

Only direct managers can see the personnel records of their staff.

Only holders of current security clearance can enter the building.

Fit Criterion

System function name or system data name.

User roles and/or names of people who have clearance.

Considerations

Is there any data that management considers to be sensitive? Is there
any data that low-level users do not want management to have access to?
Are there any processes that might cause damage or might be used for
personal gain? Are there any people who should not have access to the
system?

Avoid stating how you will design a solution to the security
requirements. For instance, don’t “design a password system.” Your aim
here is to identify the security requirement; the design will then come
from this description.

Consider asking for help. Computer security is a highly specialized
field, and one where improperly qualified people have no business. If
your product has need of more than average security, we advise you to
make use of a security consultant. Such consultants are not cheap, but
the results of inadequate security can be even more expensive.

### Integrity Requirements

Content

Specification of the required integrity of databases and other files,
and of the product itself.

Motivation

To understand the expectations for the integrity of the product’s data.
To specify what the product will do to ensure its integrity in the case
of an unwanted happening such as attack from the outside or
unintentional misuse by an authorized user.

Examples

The product shall prevent incorrect data from being introduced.

The product shall protect itself from intentional abuse.

Considerations

Organizations are relying more and more on their stored data. If this
data should be come corrupt or incorrect—or disappear—then it could be a
fatal blow to the organization. For example, almost half of small
businesses go bankrupt after a fire destroys their computer systems.
Integrity requirements are aimed at preventing complete loss, as well as
corruption, of data and processes.

### Privacy Requirements

Content

Specification of what the product has to do to ensure the privacy of
individuals about whom it stores information. The product must also
ensure that all laws related to privacy of an individual’s data are
observed.

Motivation

To ensure that the product complies with the law, and to protect the
individual privacy of your customers. Few people today look kindly on
organizations that do not observe their privacy.

Examples

The product shall make its users aware of its information practices
before collecting data from them.

The product shall notify customers of changes to its information policy.

The product shall reveal private information only in compliance with the
organization’s information policy.

The product shall protect private information in accordance with the
relevant privacy laws and the organization’s information policy.

Considerations

Privacy issues may well have legal implications, and you are advised to
consult with your organization’s legal department about the requirements
to be written in this section.

Consider what notices you must issue to your customers before collecting
their personal information. A notice might go so far as to warn
customers that you intend to put a cookie in their computer. Also, do
you have to do anything to keep customers aware that you hold their
personal information?

Customers must always be in a position to give or withhold consent when
their private data is collected or stored. Similarly, customers should
be able to view any private data and, where appropriate, ask for
correction of the data.

Also consider the integrity and security of private data—for example,
when you are storing credit card information.

### Audit Requirements

Content

Specification of what the product has to do (usually retain records) to
permit the required audit checks.

Motivation

To build a system that complies with the appropriate audit rules.

Considerations

This section may have legal implications. You are advised to seek the
approval of your organization’s auditors regarding what you write here.

You should also consider whether the product should retain information
on who has used it. The intention is to provide security such that a
user may not later deny having used the product or participated in some
form of transaction using the product.

### Immunity Requirements

Content

The requirements for what the product has to do to protect itself from
infection by unauthorized or undesirable software programs, such as
viruses, worms, and Trojan horses, among others.

Motivation

To build a product that is as secure as possible from malicious
interference.

Considerations

Each day brings more malevolence from the unknown, outside world. People
buying software, or any other kind of product, expect that it can
protect itself from outside interference.

Usability and Humanity Requirements
-----------------------------------

This section is concerned with requirements that make the product usable
and ergonomically acceptable to its hands-on users.

### Ease of Use Requirements 

Content

This section describes your client’s aspirations for how easy it is for
the intended users of the product to operate it. The product’s usability
is derived from the abilities of the expected users of the product and
the complexity of its functionality.

The usability requirements should cover properties such as these:

● Efficiency of use: How quickly or accurately the user can use the
product.

● Ease of remembering: How much the casual user is expected to remember
about using the product.

● Error rates: For some products it is crucial that the user commits
very few, or no, errors.

● Overall satisfaction in using the product: This is especially
important for commercial, interactive products that face a lot of
competition. Web sites are a good example.

● Feedback: How much feedback the user needs to feel confident that the
product is actually accurately doing what the user expects. The
necessary degree of feedback will be higher for some products (e.g.,
safety-critical products) than for others.

Motivation

To guide the product’s designers toward building a product that meets
the expectations of its eventual users.

Examples

The product shall be easy for 11-year-old children to use.

The product shall help the user to avoid making mistakes.

The product shall make the users want to use it.

The product shall be used by people with no training, and possibly no
understanding of English.

Fit Criterion

These examples may seem simplistic, but they do express the intention of
the client. To completely specify what is meant by the requirement, you
must add a measurement against which it can be tested—that is, a fit
criterion. Here are the fit criteria for the preceding examples:

Eighty percent of a test panel of 11-year-old children shall be able to
successfully complete \[list of tasks\] within \[specified time\].

One month’s use of the product shall result in a total error rate of
less than 1 percent.

An anonymous survey shall show that 75 percent of the intended users are
regularly using the product after a three-week familiarization period.

Considerations

Refer to section 3, Users of the Product, to ensure that you have
considered the usability requirements from the perspective of all the
different types of users.

It may be necessary to have special consulting sessions with your users
and your client to determine whether any special usability
considerations must be built into the product.

You could also consider consulting a usability laboratory experienced in
testing the usability of products that have a project situation
(sections 1–7 of this template) similar to yours.

### Personalization and Internationalization Requirements

Content

This section describes the way in which the product can be altered or
configured to take into account the user’s personal preferences or
choice of language.

The personalization requirements should cover issues such as the
following:

● Languages, spelling preferences, and language idioms

● Currencies, including the symbols and decimal conventions

● Personal configuration options

Motivation

To ensure that the product’s users do not have to struggle with, or
meekly accept, the builder’s cultural conventions.

Examples

The product shall retain the buyer’s buying preferences.

The product shall allow the user to select a chosen language.

Considerations

Consider the country and culture of the potential customers and users of
your product. Any out-of-country users will welcome the opportunity to
convert to their home spelling and expressions.

By allowing users to customize the way in which they use the product,
you give them the opportunity to participate more closely with your
organization as well as enjoy their own personal user experience.

You might also consider the configurability of the product.
Configurability allows different users to have different functional
variations of the product.

### Learning Requirements 

Content

Requirements specifying how easy it should be to learn to use the
product. This learning curve ranges from zero time for products intended
for placement in the public domain (e.g., a parking meter or a web site)
to a considerable amount of time for complex, highly technical products.
(We know of one product where it was necessary for graduate engineers to
spend 18 months in a training program before being qualified to use the
product.)

Motivation

To quantify the amount of time that your client feels is allowable
before a user can successfully use the product. This requirement guides
designers to understand how users will learn the product. For example,
designers may build elaborate interactive help facilities into the
product, or the product may be packaged with a tutorial. Alternatively,
the product may have to be constructed so that all of its functionality
is apparent upon first encountering it.

Examples

The product shall be easy for an engineer to learn.

A clerk shall be able to be productive within a short time.

The product shall be able to be used by members of the public who will
receive no training before using it.

The product shall be used by engineers who will attend five weeks of
training before using the product.

Fit Criterion

An engineer shall produce a \[specified result\] within \[specified
time\] of beginning to use the product, without needing to use the
manual.

After receiving \[number of hours\] training a clerk shall be able to
produce \[quantity of specified outputs\] per \[unit of time\].

\[Agreed percentage\] of a test panel shall successfully complete
\[specified task\] within \[specified time limit\].

The engineers shall achieve \[agreed percentage\] pass rate from the
final examination of the training.

Considerations

Refer to section 3, Users of the Product, to ensure that you have
considered the ease of learning requirements from the perspective of all
the different types of users.

### Understandability and Politeness Requirements

This section is concerned with discovering requirements related to
concepts and metaphors that are familiar to the intended end users.

Content

This specifies the requirement for the product to be understood by its
users. While “usability” refers to ease of use, efficiency, and similar
characteristics, “understandability” determines whether the users
instinctively know what the product will do for them and how it fits
into their view of the world. You can think of understandability as the
product being polite to its users and not expecting them to know or
learn things that have nothing to do with their business problem.

Motivation

To avoid forcing users to learn terms and concepts that are part of the
product’s internal construction and are not relevant to the users’
world. To make the product more comprehensible and thus more likely to
be adopted by its intended users.

Examples

The product shall use symbols and words that are naturally
understandable by the user community.

The product shall hide the details of its construction from the user.

Considerations

Refer to section 3, Users of the Product, and consider the world from
the point of view of each of the different types of users.

### Accessibility Requirements

Content

The requirements for how easy it should be for people with common
disabilities to access the product. These disabilities might be related
to physical disability or visual, hearing, cognitive, or other
abilities.

Motivation

In many countries it is required that some products be made available to
the disabled. In any event, it is self-defeating to exclude this sizable
community of potential customers.

Examples

The product shall be usable by partially sighted users.

The product shall conform to the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Considerations

Some users have disabilities other than the commonly described ones. In
addition, some partial disabilities are fairly common. A simple, and not
very consequential, example is that approximately 20 percent of males
are red-green colorblind.

### User Documentation Requirements 

Content

List of the user documentation to be supplied as part of the product.

Motivation

To set expectations for the documentation and to identify who will be
responsible for creating it.

Examples

Technical specifications to accompany the product.

User manuals.

Service manuals (if not covered by the technical specification).

Emergency procedure manuals (e.g., the card found in airplanes).

Installation manuals.

Considerations

Which documents do you need to deliver, and to whom? Bear in mind that
the answer to this questions depends on your organizational procedures
and roles.

For each document, consider these issues:

● The purpose of the document

● The people who will use the document

● Maintenance of the document

What level of documentation is expected? Will the users be involved in
the production of the documentation? Who will be responsible for keeping
the documentation up-to-date? What form will the documentation take?

### Training Requirements 

Content

A description of the training needed by users of the product.

Motivation

To set expectations for the training. To identify who is responsible for
creating and providing that training.

Considerations

What training will be necessary? Who will design the training? Who will
provide the training?

Look and Feel Requirements
--------------------------

### Appearance Requirements 

Content

The section contains requirements relating to the spirit of the product.
Your client may have made particular demands for the product, such as
corporate branding, colors to be used, and so on. This section captures
the requirements for the appearance. Do not attempt to design it until
the appearance requirements are known.

Motivation

To ensure that the appearance of the product conforms to the
organization’s expectations.

Examples

The product shall be attractive to a teenage audience.

The product shall comply with corporate branding standards.

Fit Criterion

A sampling of representative teenagers shall, without prompting or
enticement, start using the product within four minutes of their first
encounter with it.

The office of branding shall certify the product complies with the
current standards.

Considerations

Even if you are using prototypes, it is important to understand the
requirements for the appearance. The prototype is used to help elicit
requirements; it should not be thought of as a substitute for the
requirements.

### Style Requirements 

Content

Requirements that specify the mood, style, or feeling of the product,
which influences the way a potential customer will see the product.
Also, the stakeholders’ intentions for the amount of interaction the
user is to have with the product.

In this section, you would also describe the appearance of the package
if this is to be a manufactured product. The package may have some
requirements as to its size, style, and consistency with other packages
put out by your organization. Keep in mind the European laws on
packaging, which require that the package not be significantly larger
than the product it encloses.

The style requirements that you record here will guide the designers to
create a product as envisioned by your client.

Motivation

Given the state of today’s market and people’s expectations, we cannot
afford to build products that have the wrong style. Once the functional
requirements are satisfied, it is often the appearance and style of
products that determine whether they are successful. Your task in this
section is to determine precisely how the product shall appear to its
intended consumer.

Example

The product shall appear authoritative.

Fit Criterion

After their first encounter with the product, 70 percent of
representative potential customers shall agree they feel they can trust
the product.

Considerations

The look and feel requirements specify your client’s vision of the
product’s appearance. The requirements may at first seem to be rather
vague (e.g., “conservative and professional appearance”), but these will
be quantified by their fit criteria. The fit criteria give you the
opportunity to extract from your client precisely what is meant, and
give the designer precise instructions on what he is to accomplish.

Operational and Environmental Requirements
------------------------------------------

### Expected Physical Environment

Content

This section specifies the physical environment in which the product
will operate.

Motivation

To highlight conditions that might need special requirements,
preparations, or training. These requirements ensure that the product is
fit to be used in its intended environment.

Examples

The product shall be used by a worker, standing up, outside in cold,
rainy conditions.

The product shall be used in noisy conditions with a lot of dust.

The product shall be able to fit in a pocket or purse.

The product shall be usable in dim light.

The product shall not be louder than the existing noise level in the
environment.

Considerations

The work environment: Is the product to operate in some unusual
environment? Does this lead to special requirements? Also see section
11, Usability and Humanity Requirements.

### Requirements for Interfacing with Adjacent Systems

Content

This section describes the requirements to interface with partner
applications and/or devices that the product needs to successfully
operate.

Motivation

Requirements for the interfaces to other applications often remain
undiscovered until implementation time. Avoid a high degree of rework by
discovering these requirements early.

Examples

The products shall work on the last four releases of the five most
popular browsers.

The new version of the spreadsheet must be able to access data from the
previous two versions.

Our product must interface with the applications that run on the remote
weather stations.

Fit Criterion

For each inter-application interface, specify the following elements:

● The data content

● The physical material content

● The medium that carries the interface

● The frequency

● The volume

### Productization Requirements

Content

Any requirements that are necessary to make the product into a
distributable or salable item. It is also appropriate to describe here
the operations needed to install a software product successfully.

Motivation

To ensure that if work must be done to get the product out the door,
then that work becomes part of the requirements. Also, to quantify the
client’s and users’ expectations about the amount of time, money, and
resources they will need to allocate to install the product.

Examples

The product shall be distributed as a ZIP file.

The product shall be able to be installed by an untrained user without
recourse to separately printed instructions.

The product shall be of a size such that it can fit on one CD.

Considerations

Some products have special needs to turn them into a salable or usable
product. You might consider that the product has to be protected such
that only paid-up customers can access it.

Ask questions of your marketing department to discover unstated
assumptions that have been made about the specified environment and the
customers’ expectations of how long installation will take and how much
it will cost.

Most commercial products have some needs in this area.

### Release Requirements 

Content

Specification of the intended release cycle for the product and the form
that the release shall take.

Motivation

To make everyone aware of how often you intend to produce new releases
of the product.

Examples

The maintenance releases will be offered to end users once a year.

Each release shall not cause previous features to fail.

Fit Criterion

Description of the type of maintenance plus the amount of effort
budgeted for it.

Considerations

Do you have any existing contractual commitments or maintenance
agreements that might be affected by the new product?

Cultural and Political Requirements
-----------------------------------

### Cultural Requirements

Content

This section contains requirements that are specific to the sociological
factors that affect the acceptability of the product. If you are
developing a product for foreign markets, then these requirements are
particularly relevant.

Motivation

To bring out in the open requirements that are difficult to discover
because they are outside the cultural experience of the developers.

Examples

The product shall not be offensive to religious or ethnic groups.

The product shall be able to distinguish between French, Italian, and
British road-numbering systems.

The product shall keep a record of public holidays for all countries in
the European Union and for all states in the United States.

Considerations

Question whether the product is intended for a culture other than the
one with which you are familiar. Ask whether people in other countries
or in other types of organizations will use the product. Do these people
have different habits, holidays, superstitions, or cultural norms that
do not apply to your own culture? Are there colors, icons, or words that
have different meanings in another cultural environment?

### Political Requirements

Content

This section contains requirements that are specific to the political
factors that affect the acceptability of the product.

Motivation

To understand requirements that sometimes appear irrational.

Examples

The product shall be installed using only American-made components.

The product shall make all functionality available to the CEO.

Considerations

Did you intend to develop the product on a Macintosh, when the office
manager has laid down an edict that only Windows machines are permitted?

Is a director also on the board of a company that manufactures products
similar to the one that you intend to build?

Whether you agree with these political requirements has little bearing
on the outcome. The reality is that the system has to comply with
political requirements even if you can find a better, more efficient, or
more economical solution. A few probing questions here may save some
heartache later.

The political requirements might be purely concerned with the politics
inside your organization. However, in other situations you may need to
consider the politics inside your customers’ organizations or the
national politics of the country.

Legal Requirements
------------------

### Compliance Requirements

Content

A statement specifying the legal requirements for this system.

Motivation

To comply with the law so as to avoid later delays, lawsuits, and legal
fees.

Examples

Personal information shall be implemented so as to comply with the Data
Protection Act.

Fit Criterion

Lawyers’ opinion that the product does not break any laws.

Considerations

Consider consulting lawyers to help identify the legal requirements.

Are there any copyrights or other intellectual property that must be
protected? Conversely, do any competitors have copyrights on which you
might be in danger of infringing?

Is it a requirement that developers have not seen competitors’ code or
even have worked for competitors?

The Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Act, the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act may have
implications for you. Check with your company lawyer.

Might any pending legislation affect the development of this system?

Are there any aspects of criminal law you should consider?

Have you considered the tax laws that affect your product?

Are there any labor laws (e.g., working hours) relevant to your product?

### Standards Requirements

Content

A statement specifying applicable standards and referencing detailed
standards descriptions. This does not refer to the law of the land—think
of it as an internal law imposed by your company.

Motivation

To comply with standards so as to avoid later delays.

Example

The product shall comply with MilSpec standards.

The product shall comply with insurance industry standards.

The product shall be developed according to SSADM standard development
steps.

Fit Criterion

The appropriate standard-keeper certifies that the standard has been
adhered to.

Considerations

It is not always apparent that there are applicable standards because
their existence is often taken for granted. Consider the following:

● Do any industry bodies have applicable standards?

● Does the industry have a code of practice, watchdog, or ombudsman?

● Are there any special development steps for this type of product?

Design
======

System Design
-------------

### Design goals

Content

Design goals are important properties of the system to be optimized, and
which may affect the overall design of the system. For example computer
games place a higher priority on speed than accuracy, and so the physics
engine for a computer game may make some rough approximations and
assumptions that allow it to run as fast as possible while sacrificing
accuracy, whereas the physics calculations performed by NASA must be
much more rigorously correct, even at the expense of speed.

Note an important difference between design goals and requirements:
Requirements include specific values that must be met in order for the
product to be acceptable to the client, whereas design goals are
properties that the designers strive to make "as good as possible",
without specific criteria for acceptability. ( Note also that the same
property may appear in both a requirement and a design goal, so a design
goal may be to make the system run as fast as possible, with a
requirement that says any speed below a certain specified threshold is
unacceptable. )

Project Issues
==============

Open Issues 
------------

Issues that have been raised and do not yet have a conclusion.

Content

A statement of factors that are uncertain and might make significant
difference to the product.

Motivation

To bring uncertainty out in the open and provide objective input to risk
analysis.

Examples

Our investigation into whether the new version of the processor will be
suitable for our application is not yet complete.

The government is planning to change the rules about who is responsible
for gritting the motorways, but we do not know what those changes might
be.

Considerations

Are there any issues that have come up from the requirements gathering
that have not yet been resolved? Have you heard of any changes that
might occur in the other organizations or systems on your context
diagram? Are there any legislative changes that might affect your
system? Are there any rumors about your hardware or software suppliers
that might have an impact?

Off-the-Shelf Solutions
-----------------------

### Ready-Made Products

Content

List of existing products that should be investigated as potential
solutions. Reference any surveys that have been done on these products.

Motivation

To give consideration to whether a solution can be bought.

Considerations

Could you buy something that already exists or is about to become
available? It may not be possible at this stage to make this
determination with a lot of confidence, but any likely products should
be listed here.

Also consider whether some products must not be used.

### Reusable Components

Content

Description of the candidate components, either bought from outside or
built by your company, that could be used by this project. List
libraries that could be a source of components.

Motivation

Reuse rather than reinvention.

### Products That Can Be Copied 

Content

List of other similar products or parts of products that you can legally
copy or easily modify.

Motivation

Reuse rather than reinvention.

Examples

Another electricity company has built a customer service system. Its
hardware is different from ours, but we could buy its specification and
cut our analysis effort by approximately 60 percent.

Considerations

While a ready-made solution may not exist, perhaps something, in its
essence, is similar enough that you could copy, and possibly modify, it
to better effect than starting from scratch. This approach is
potentially dangerous because it relies on the base system being of good
quality.

This question should always be answered. The act of answering it will
force you to look at other existing solutions to similar problems.

New Problems
------------

### Effects on the Current Environment

Content

A description of how the new product will affect the current
implementation environment. This section should also cover things that
the new product should *not* do.

Motivation

The intention is to discover early any potential conflicts that might
otherwise not be realized until implementation time.

Examples

Any change to the scheduling system will affect the work of the
engineers in the divisions and the truck drivers.

Considerations

Is it possible that the new system might damage some existing system?
Can people be displaced or otherwise affected by the new system?

These issues require a study of the current environment. A model
highlighting the effects of the change is a good way to make this
information widely understandable.

### Effects on the Installed Systems 

Content

Specification of the interfaces between new and existing systems.

Motivation

Very rarely is a new development intended to stand completely alone.
Usually the new system must coexist with some older system. This
question forces you to look carefully at the existing system, examining
it for potential conflicts with the new development.

### Potential User Problems

Content

Details of any adverse reaction that might be suffered by existing
users.

Motivation

Sometimes existing users are using a product in such a way that they
will suffer ill effects from the new system or feature. Identify any
likely adverse user reactions, and determine whether we care about those
reactions and what precautions we will take.

### Limitations in the Anticipated Implementation Environment That May Inhibit the New Product

Content

*Statement of any potential problems with the new automated technology
or new ways* of structuring the organization.

Motivation

The intention is to make early discovery of any potential conflicts that
might otherwise not be realized until implementation time.

Examples

The planned new server is not powerful enough to cope with our projected
growth pattern.

The size and weight of the new product do not fit into the physical
environment.

The power capabilities will not satisfy the new product’s projected
consumption.

Considerations

This requires a study of the intended implementation environment.

### Follow-Up Problems 

Content

Identification of situations that we might not be able to cope with.

Motivation

To guard against situations where the product might fail.

Considerations

Will we create a demand for our product that we are not able to service?
Will the new system cause us to run afoul of laws that do not currently
apply? Will the existing hardware cope?

There are potentially hundreds of unwanted effects. It pays to answer
this question very carefully.

Tasks
-----

### Project Planning

Content

Details of the life cycle and approach that will be used to deliver the
product. A high-level process diagram showing the tasks and the
interfaces between them is a good way to communicate this information.

Motivation

To specify the approach that will be taken to deliver the product so
that everyone has the same expectations.

Considerations

Depending on the maturity level of your process, the new product will be
developed using your standard approach. However, some circumstances are
unique to a particular product and will necessitate changes to your life
cycle. While these considerations are not product requirements, they are
needed if the product is to be successfully developed.

If possible, attach an estimate of the time and resources needed for
each task based on the requirements that you have specified. Attach your
estimates to the events, use cases, and/or functions that you specified
in sections 8 and 9.

Do not forget issues related to data conversion, user training, and
cutover. These needs are usually ignored when projects set
implementation dates.

### Planning of the Development Phases

Content

Specification of each phase of development and the components in the
operating environment.

Motivation

To identify the phases necessary to implement the operating environment
for the new system so that the implementation can be managed.

Fit Criterion

Name of the phase.

Required operational date.

Operating environment components included.

Functional requirements included.

Nonfunctional requirements included.

Considerations

Identify which hardware and other devices are necessary for each phase
of the new system. This list may not be known at the time of the
requirements process, as these devices may be decided at design time.

Migration to the New Product
----------------------------

### Requirements for Migration to the New Product

Content

A list of the conversion activities. Timetable for implementation.

Motivation

To identify conversion tasks as input to the project planning process.

Considerations

Will you use a phased implementation to install the new system? If so,
describe which requirements will be implemented by each of the major
phases.

What kind of data conversion is necessary? Must special programs be
written to transport data from an existing system to the new one? If so,
describe the requirements for these programs here.

What kind of manual backup is needed while the new system is installed?

When are each of the major components to be put in place? When are the
phases of the implementation to be released?

Is there a need to run the new product in parallel with the existing
product?

Will we need additional or different staff?

Is any special effort needed to decommission the old product?

This section is the timetable for implementation of the new system.

### Data That Has to Be Modified or Translated for the New System 

Content

List of data translation tasks.

Motivation

To discover missing tasks that will affect the size and boundaries of
the project.

Fit Criterion

Description of the current technology that holds the data.

Description of the new technology that will hold the data.

Description of the data translation tasks.

Foreseeable problems.

Considerations

Every time you make an addition to your dictionary (see section 5), ask
this question: Where is this data currently held, and will the new
system affect that implementation?

Risks
-----

All projects involve risk—namely, the risk that something will go wrong.
Risk is not necessarily a bad thing, as no progress is made without
taking some risk. However, there is a difference between unmanaged
risk—say, shooting dice at a craps table—and managed risk, where the
probabilities are well understood and contingency plans are made. Risk
is only a bad thing if the risks are ignored and they become problems.
Risk management entails assessing which risks are most likely to apply
to the project, deciding a course of action if they become problems, and
monitoring projects to give early warnings of risks becoming problems.

This section of your specification should contain a list of the most
likely risks and the most serious risks for your project. For each risk,
include the probability of that risk becoming a problem. Capers Jones’s
*Assessment and Control of Software Risks* (Prentice-Hall, Englewood
Cliffs, N.J., 1994) gives comprehensive lists of risks and their
probabilities; you can use these lists as a starting point. For example,
Jones cites the following risks as being the most serious:

• Inaccurate metrics

• Inadequate measurement

• Excessive schedule pressure

• Management malpractice

• Inaccurate cost estimating

• Silver bullet syndrome

• Creeping user requirements

• Low quality

• Low productivity

• Cancelled projects

Use your knowledge of the requirements as input to discover which risks
are most relevant to your project.

It is also useful input to project management if you include the impact
on the schedule, or the cost, if the risk does become a problem.

Costs
-----

For details on how to estimate requirements effort and costs, refer to
Appendix C Function Point Counting: A Simplified Introduction

The other cost of requirements is the amount of money or effort that you
have to spend building them into a product. Once the requirements
specification is complete, you can use one of the estimating methods to
assess the cost, expressing the result as a monetary amount or time to
build.

There is no best method to use when estimating. Keep in mind, however,
that your estimates should be based on some tangible, countable
artifact. If you are using this template, then, as a result of doing the
work of requirements specification, you are producing many measurable
deliverables. For example:

● Number of input and output flows on the work context

● Number of business events

● Number of product use cases

● Number of functional requirements

● Number of nonfunctional requirements

● Number of requirements constraints

● Number of function points

The more detailed the work you do on your requirements, the more
accurate your deliverables will be. Your cost estimate is the amount of
resources you estimate each type of deliverable will take to produce
within your environment. You can create some very early cost estimates
based on the work context. At that stage, your knowledge of the work
will be general, and you should reflect this vagueness by making the
cost estimate a range rather than a single figure.

As you increase your knowledge of the requirements, we suggest you try
using function point counting—not because it is an inherently superior
method, but because it is so widely accepted. So much is known about
function point counting that it is possible to make easy comparisons
with other products and other installations’ productivity.

It is important that your client be told at this stage what the product
is likely to cost. You usually express this amount as the total cost to
complete the product, but you may also find it advantageous to point out
the cost of the requirements effort, or the costs of individual
requirements.

Whatever you do, do not leave the costs in the lap of hysterical
optimism. Make sure that this section includes meaningful numbers based
on tangible deliverables.

Waiting Room
------------

Requirements that will not be part of the next release. These
requirements might be included in future releases of the product.

Content

Any type of requirement.

Motivation

To allow requirements to be gathered, even though they cannot be part of
the current development. To ensure that good ideas are not lost.

Considerations

The requirements-gathering process often throws up requirements that are
beyond the sophistication of, or time allowed for, the current release
of the product. This section holds these requirements in waiting. The
intention is to avoid stifling the creativity of your users and clients,
by using a repository to retain future requirements. You are also
managing expectations by making it clear that you take these
requirements seriously, although they will not be part of the
agreed-upon product.

Many people use the waiting room as a way of planning future versions of
the product. Each requirement in the waiting room is tagged with its
intended version number. As a requirement progresses closer to
implementation, then you can spend more time on it and add details such
as the cost and benefit attached to that requirement.

You might also prioritize the contents of your waiting room.
“Low-hanging fruit”—requirements that provide a high benefit at a low
cost of implementation—are the highest-ranking candidates for the next
release. You would also give a high waiting room rank to requirements
for which there is a pent-up demand.

Ideas for Solutions
-------------------

When you gather requirements, you focus on finding out what the real
requirements are and try to avoid coming up with solutions. However,
when creative people start to think about a problem, they always
generate ideas about potential solutions. This section of the template
is a place to put those ideas so that you do not forget them and so that
you can separate them from the real business requirements.

Content

Any idea for a solution that you think is worth keeping for future
consideration. This can take the form of rough notes, sketches, pointers
to other documents, pointers to people, pointers to existing products,
and so on. The aim is to capture, with the least amount of effort, an
idea that you can return to later.

Motivation

To make sure that good ideas are not lost. To help you separate
requirements from solutions.

Considerations

While you are gathering requirements, you will inevitably have solution
ideas; this section offers a way to capture them. Bear in mind that this
section will not necessarily be included in every document that you
publish.

Project Retrospective
---------------------

Content

At the end of every project you should reflect upon what methods were
used that worked out well and should be repeated in the future, and also
what methods did not work out well and should be avoided. Any
recommendations, suggestions, or ideas for how to do things better in
the future should also be documented

Motivation

To learn from experience, and to continually strive for process
improvement.

Considerations

When things don't go well, it is important to distinguish whether the
methods themselves were poor, or simply poorly implemented in this
particular case, or whether they just weren't right for this particular
project / group of engineers.

Glossary
========

The glossary defines terms that may not be familiar to all readers. This
is especially important if the document is expected to reach a wide and
varied audience, such as school children. The glossary may be placed at
either the beginning or the end of the document.

**Flotsam:** Any part of a ship or its cargo found floating on the
water, whether it was deliberately or accidentally lost by its original
owners.

**Jetsam:** Any part of a ship or its cargo that is deliberately cast
off ( jettisoned ) by its original owners, generally in order to lighten
the ship, whether it floats or sinks.
